# E-Commerce-Fraud-Detection-and-Prevention-System
E-Commerce Fraud Detection and Prevention System is an academic project that uses machine learning to identify and prevent fraudulent online transactions. The system analyzes transaction data, detects suspicious patterns, and visualizes fraud trends to improve e-commerce security and decision-making.

Overview
The E-Commerce Fraud Detection and Prevention System is an academic project developed to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in online transactions. The system uses machine learning techniques and data analysis to detect suspicious behavior and improve transaction security in e-commerce platforms.

Objectives
Detect fraudulent and suspicious e-commerce transactions
Analyze fraud patterns and trends using data visualization
Build a robust fraud detection system to enhance online security

Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of online shopping, e-commerce platforms are increasingly vulnerable to fraud such as credit card fraud, account takeovers, and friendly fraud. Traditional rule-based systems are insufficient to detect complex fraud patterns. This project aims to address these challenges using machine learning.

System Features
Fraud type distribution analysis 
Year-wise fraud trend analysis 
Machine learning–based fraud classification
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Visualization of real-world fraud insights

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization
The project includes visual analysis such as:
Distribution of e-commerce fraud types
Year-over-year fraud trend analysis
Comparative analysis using bar graphs and pie charts

Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
These models are used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical data patterns.
